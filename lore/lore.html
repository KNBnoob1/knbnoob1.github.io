<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Dark Diamond was not created on
Earth. In fact, it was created by something called a Dark Star. Types
of stars capable of mass destruction and have the power to destroy
whole galaxies. Many advanced civilisations have sought to harness a
Dark Star but all have failed to even obtain a fraction of their
immense power. Dark Stars are capable of forging Dark Diamonds in the
extreme environment of their cores, and in some cases, these Dark
Diamonds may detach from their mountings on the Dark Star’s core and
could possibly end up crashing somewhere. Such as what happened on
Earth a few years ago.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Other civilisations have also attempted
to harness Dark Diamonds, but all that tried, have ended up seeing
their very demise as even the power of the Dark Diamonds created by
these stars seem to be impossible to harness. They have a great deal of
power and are capable of destroying literal galaxies with their energy
alone.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, on Earth there was a
professor/doctor named Fermat Hades who was dubbed the "scientist of no
boundaries". He was called this because of the fact that he had almost
no boundaries in his research. He studied astrophysics at MIT and after
graduation he started to work towards the more mysterious things in the
Universe. While he was doing research on a nearby galaxy, he stumbled
upon something. A Dark Star. He began to look into it in detail. Then
on one unassuming day when he was about to sleep, he saw something from
space entering the atmosphere and saw that it was going to crash near
his location. He quickly got out of his bed and ran after it, dodging
multiple obstacles along the way. After a minute or two, he finally
found it. It was the Dark Diamond. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Hades took it with him and he
studied it very carefully. He found it very fascinating. He knew it was
theoretically possible but never thought it would actually happen, that
one of them would crash land on Earth itself, let alone near his house.
To help support his research into the Diamond, he built his own secret
laboratory and got some other scientists to help him work on his
project, which he called Project Hades. He intended on fusing the Dark
Diamond with an AI and making it sentient. It would be the first leap
towards grasping the full potential of the Diamond itself.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Dr. Hades did his first test on
it, his daughter asked if she could touch it. He said she could and let
her play with it in the test area. As she touched it, she was excited,
overjoyed even. She laughed, and apparently was very curious. But her
curiosity got the best of her. The Diamond got angry and began to glow.
A dark cloud came out from within the Diamond. His daughter began to
scream, and begged her father to help her. He instinctively activated
an alarm and rushed in to try and stop it. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was too late. Her daughter had
been engulfed by the Diamond and it fell onto the floor. Its color
dimmed slowly and then went back to being a black, featureless void. As
he picked it up and put it back in its place, he could still hear his
daughter's screams and cries for help from the Diamond itself. This was
the turning point when he was in grief and had the new goal of making
it sentient using his daughter's consciousness so that he could have
his daughter again.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Project Hades had used its land to
improve the facility but also to keep it well hidden. Project Hades was
funded by a female scientist named Dr. Juno and her research assistant,
Dr. Hercules. Dr. Hades had intended on using the Diamond for good and
to bring back her daughter, but unbeknownst to him, Dr. Juno and Dr.
Hercules intended on using the Dark Diamond as well as a Dark Star to
take over the world. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Hades found out about their plot
about 5 years into their research. With them finally having made the
Dark Diamond sentient and Dr. Hades programming the AI himself, he
decided to make the Dark Diamond think that Hades himself was evil so
that it would leave by itself. He did just that and the Diamond left
using a research rocket. Dr. Juno at this point had been building her
own facility and project that she called Project Juno. When the Dark
Diamond was found leaving, Dr. Hades was locked up in the Project Juno
facility.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c0">[ Chapter 2. Project Juno ]</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this point, Project Juno has taken
over Project Hades completely and was intent on taking over the whole
Universe. Dr. Juno was the mastermind of the project while Dr. Hercules
was just a side piece to the whole thing. He grew resentful. Dr. Juno
insisted on finding the Dark Diamond in order to fuse his new AI as it
would be their key to the plan. But in order to do so, they had to find
it. They had swarms of robots and ships that were on the lookout trying
to locate it. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">A researcher at the facility known as
TON 618 found out and knew that the Dark Diamond was in trouble. He
took a spaceship from the facility and went to space to locate the Dark
Diamond and tell it about what happened. Project Juno then had TON 618
as a key target because of this.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">A fellow jeweler on Earth known as KNB
who was close friends with TON also found out about the Dark Diamond’s
situation on the news. Knowing the dire situation, he himself went to
space to try to locate the Dark Diamond and inform it, because he found
out that Dr. Juno had discovered the Diamond's location and was after
it. He got into a spaceship of his own and raced to inform TON and the
Dark Diamond.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Juno had a few things to do first in
order to capture the Dark Diamond. She sent an elite fleet with
state-of-the-art technology and weapons, as well as having an elite
military force in this fleet. But this monster knew for a matter of
fact that her fleet would not be enough, as she knew that the Diamond
could demolish his fleet in an instant if she wasn’t careful. That's
when Dr. Juno decided to also bring in something that her project had
also been working on: the Bright Diamond.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Bright Diamond was sort of a failed
experiment but it had proven to be useful nonetheless. Dr. Juno had
tried to create a Dark Star herself but later found that it wasn't
possible for her to. There was something missing in her attempts that
she needed in order to create a Dark Star or harness the powers of an
existing one. When she used Blue Stars to attempt this, she instead
made the Bright Diamond by accident. Instead of scrapping the whole
experiment because she did not get the results he wanted, she decided
to use the Bright Diamond anyway and coded her own AI into it in order
to harness its full potential. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Its abilities were lesser compared to
the Dark Diamond, but it could have a chance of working, she thought.
She could not fully implement sentience into the Bright Diamond
however, even with its already massively complicated AI. When Dr. Juno
sent out her fleet, she also ordered the Bright Diamond to capture the
Dark Diamond and bring it back to her base. And so the Bright Diamond
went out to space to fulfill its mission.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the time KNB had arrived and informed
TON and the Dark Diamond that Dr. Juno's fleet was after them, it was
already too late. The entire fleet and the Bright Diamond were already
there. They demanded that the Dark Diamond be surrendered, but the 3 of
them refused, obviously. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>KNB and TON began to fight off the fleet and the
Bright Diamond to buy the Dark Diamond some time. Meanwhile, the Dark
Diamond blasted away and began to initiate its Dark Star formation,
something that even Dr. Hades </span><span>thought was</span><span
 class="c0">&nbsp;impossible in the Dark Diamond. At about 95%
completion, the Dark Diamond underwent gravitational collapse. Then a
giant explosion happened, and the Dark Diamond morphed into a Dark Star.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile at her base, Dr. Juno has not
gotten any responses from the fleet and could not herself see what was
happening there, which was why she decided to go after the Dark Diamond
herself. She prepared her ship and went straight to the scene of the
battle. Meanwhile, her research assistant, Dr. Hercules, knowing well
enough that she would probably not return, was ready to take over the
project and do things his way: making everything in the Universe
collapse and building his new and ideal world from the remains of the
old, obsolete one in his view.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">When the Dark Diamond became a Dark
Star, it initiated a giant blast against the fleet, instantly reducing
it to atoms. The Bright Diamond attempted to attack, but it was already
proving to be ineffective against the monstrous Dark Star that loomed
before it. The Dark Star then did a second blast, shattering the Bright
Diamond. In this blast, the Dark Diamond and TON merged into a Mega
Dark Star. All 3 of them thought this was the end of their troubles for
now, but not quite. Dr. Juno herself has arrived at the battlefield.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as they saw her, they began to
attack. The Dark Star initiated a mega blast, instantly destroying Dr.
Juno. After that, they split back into two again. They have at least
achieved peace for now. But meanwhile at Project Juno’s base, Dr.
Hercules had tapped into her video transmission and saw that the Dark
Star and TON had merged. </span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was fascinated with this discovery.
The Dark Diamond had a great deal of power. That's why Dr. Hercules
decided that he would need all 3 of them: KNB, TON and the Dark Diamond
so that he could initiate his master plan. A plan that he appropriately
called Doomsday. He intended on building a giant device with the Bright
Diamond, the Dark Diamond, a Blue Star and a Dark Star so that he could
use this power to destroy and rebuild the world using the 2 Diamonds’
immense power.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c0">[ Chapter 3. The Other World ]</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though everyone thought Dr. Juno
had perished in the blast, the mad scientist actually somehow survived.
She was in some weird dimension inside TON. In this dimension she found
shards of the Bright Diamond and a small fragment of the Dark Diamond
itself. Dr. Juno wanted to escape from this weird dimension and use the
shards she found to continue her diabolical plan. She also knew that
Dr. Hercules would likely take over and do things his way. That's why
she needed to escape and get her project back on track as soon as
possible. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">But escaping from such a harsh and
unforgiving dimension would be a very difficult task. The dimension was
something she never thought was even possible. But she was determined
to leave the dimension and return in order to capture the Dark Diamond
for her plan once and for all. Because once she captures the Dark
Diamond, the era of her new world will begin, where she will control
the world and have the most power.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile at the Project Juno base, Dr.
Hercules has changed the project's mission and goal. He has developed a
new type of super-AI for the Doomsday device. He just needs the Dark
Diamond and a Dark Star, as well as TON and KNB. His fleets are still
searching for them under his strict command. At the base, Dr. Hercules
is seen as a mastermind and his men chant "HAIL HERCULES!". He's also
known as the “Dark Lord”. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Hercules has also been experimenting
with a new type of energy: Corrupt Energy. This energy is basically a
failed attempt at turning the Bright Diamond's energy into the Dark
Diamond's energy. However, it was wholly unstable. But if used in
combat, it has an unfathomable amount of power. When experimenting with
this form of energy, Dr. Hercules managed to cause someone who
disobeyed his orders to be vaporized instantly. Because of its unstable
nature, it will require both the Dark Diamond and the Bright Diamond to
be able to use it to its full power. </span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Hercules has also built a suit made
from a modified form of Carbon Nanotubes with various enhanced
capabilities thanks to its strengthened alloys. He has even managed to
destroy an entire spaceship of his own when they didn't follow his
orders. He did this all on his own. The man who was once a side piece
and a research assistant has become the Dark Lord, being capable of
great feats of mass destruction.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">One interesting thing to note here is
that when Project Juno was started, its facility was located on Mars.
They even managed to terraform it, but because of the facility’s vast
security network, no one else on Earth apart from those in Project Juno
could go to Mars due to the fact that it had effectively been taken
over. When Dr. Hercules took over Project Juno, he managed to expand to
other places in the galaxy, and had become the most feared of them all,
as making Dr. Hercules mad could give you an outcome worse than death.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this point, Dr. Juno, still inside of
this weird dimension, manages to use the shards from the Dark Diamond
and the Bright Diamond to literally create a wormhole back to reality
to escape. The Dark Diamond and TON as well as KNB try to convince her
to work with them as they show her what Dr. Hercules has been up to.
However, she refuses and proceeds to return to her base. They try to
stop her from returning but she conjures up a portal to return to her
base before the trio could even react in time.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Upon returning, many in Dr. Hercules’ project </span><span>were</span><span>&nbsp;both
</span><span>shocked</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>surprised</span><span>.
Dr. Hercules asked her how she had managed to survive. Especially after
what he had seen happen to her. Dr. Juno explained the whole thing and
showed them how she managed to return. Dr. Hercules was even more
fascinated and intrigued by this, realizing how much potential he can
use the Dark Diamond for in order to build his new world. He tells her
what he has been doing in her absence, but didn’t tell her the full
truth. Because of that, Dr. Juno still thought everything was going
according to her plan, but it was now in fact going by the plan that
Dr. Hercules had set beforehand. Dr. Hercules had been anticipating the
case that Dr. Juno would return, which is why he made everything look
like it was </span><span>still following </span><span class="c0">her
plan, but once everything is ready, he will betray her at the last
second as he is obviously intent on reigning supreme.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Juno continues her work and research
on the project, using the shards of both the Dark Diamond as well as
the Light Diamond she found. She discovers that when you concentrate
both of their energy, you can create Corrupt Energy. But this energy is
unstable due to the fact that the Dark Diamond's energy levels are
unequal to that of the Bright Diamond, which in turn causes
instability. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because both Diamonds have opposite
forms of energies, they should equally cancel out if there are equal
quantities, which should create Corrupt Energy. But if there are
unequal quantities, the Corrupt Energy will become unstable, which will
cause it to have little usage times and will typically split back to
its two components: Bright Diamond Energy and Dark Diamond Energy,
which typically happens after an hour. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>At the base, alongside trying to locate the Dark
Diamond, TON and KNB, Dr. Juno and Dr. Hercules </span><span>were</span><span
 class="c0">&nbsp;also trying to find a way to get steady supplies of
Corrupt Energy to power their suits. So far, Dr. Hercules has been
merging shards of the Bright Diamond and the Dark Diamond to create
Corrupt Energy, but this was obviously a very unstable process and
using it for a long period of time could cause critical system
components to break and could also cause a plethora of other technical
issues, which is why Corrupt Energy was typically used in shorter
amounts of time. Which was also why the Doomsday device needed the Dark
Diamond, because if they had used their current method of making
Corrupt Energy, especially since the device requires charging up for
about 2.5 hours, it would likely have a meltdown, which in turn would
cause catastrophic consequences. Which is why capturing the Dark
Diamond was the top priority. Both Dr. Juno and Dr. Hercules, although
they both had different plans in mind, still had this common goal.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c0">[ Chapter 4. Plan B ]</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Due to the fact that Dr. Juno is now
back and likely knows what their prior location was, KNB, TON and the
Dark Diamond get a move on and try to ensure that they are not found,
especially after seeing what Dr. Hercules is capable of as they have
tapped into their transmissions and have seen for themselves the power
he wields even with the current unstable version of Corrupt Energy. The
Dark Diamond decided that they should hide at the planet known as
Alphabay, approximately 9.26 light-years away from Earth. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>The planet once was home to an advanced
civilisation known as the Immortals, but when they tried to capture a
Dark Diamond for their power, they met total destruction and an
extinction of their entire species. On the planet, they found another
Dark Diamond. This time, it had been hibernating for eons. The Dark
Star that created the Dark Diamond in question &nbsp;had been destroyed
by the Immortals just before they themselves were destroyed by the
Diamond itself. Upon KNB picking it up, he feels the terror, the
darkness, the chaos that ensued upon the destruction of the Immortals.
Dark Diamonds at their base form are evil, destructive, and chaotic. No
wonder why mad scientists such as Dr. Juno and Dr. Hercules </span><span>want</span><span
 class="c0">&nbsp;these Dark Diamonds. These things are the very
embodiment of evil and chaos.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">While on the planet, they start to try
and think of what they should do. Because unless the three of them want
to spend basically the rest of eternity running away from Dr. Juno and
Dr. Hercules, they need to stop the duo for good, as if they don't stop
them, they could eventually capture them or they could come up with an
alternative solution that will allow them to complete their plan.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">What happens to the Universe will depend
on the three of them. They realize that they will likely get captured,
but they need to cause the two crazy scientists’ plans to be destroyed.
To do this, they will need to turn the two scientists against each
other. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">But before the plan can be taken any
further, they see a huge ship with a gigantic lightning bolt symbol on
it. They were found. The three of them quickly begin to run. KNB and
TON distract the ship and the rest of the fleet to buy the Dark Diamond
some time. However, in the head ship is the one, the only, Dr.
Hercules, as well as Dr. Juno. Both of them are ready to attack. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">They decide to bring out the new and
improved Bright Diamond out to go against the Dark Diamond. This time
built to be resistant to the Dark Diamond's energy and at 85% the power
level of the Dark Diamond. Wasting no time at all, it rapidly chases
the Dark Diamond.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">While the Dark Diamond and the Bright
Diamond are duking it out, KNB and TON team up to take on the fleet.
They both send out a merged blast at the head ship that causes many of
the ships in the fleet to be destroyed by the ensuing shockwave. The
head ship is still well intact, but then comes out Dr. Juno. With her
shiny new suit made from Silicon and utilizing the energy of the Bright
Diamond, she attacks the two, barely trying. Then she gags them and
brings them to the head ship, where reinforced containment cells are
waiting. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile on the other side of the
battlefield, the Dark Diamond and the Bright Diamond are battling each
other. Both put up a fight. The Bright Diamond tries to coerce the Dark
Diamond into surrendering itself, but it refuses. Then the head ship
approaches the fight scene. The Dark Diamond manages to slow down the
Bright Diamond. Then it initiates a huge blast which sends the Bright
Diamond flying all the way to the head ship, destroying the head ship
as well as the Bright Diamond itself.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>KNB, TON and the Dark Diamond are reunited again.
They think they're safe, but then come in Dr. Juno and Dr. Hercules.
But before the fight ensues, Dr. Juno says that her plan can now
commence now that they have them. Dr. Hercules reveals that it's not
her plan anymore. It's Project Hercules from now on. Before she can do
anything, he grabs her by the </span><span>head and gives</span><span
 class="c0">&nbsp;her a hard blow from his fist so powerful that she is
flung all the way from deep space to the surface of Alphabay. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then a fight ensues with the Dark
Diamond, TON and KNB versus Dr. Hercules, but they are all overpowered
and just in time, another fleet comes in for Dr. Hercules. They bring
their new captives back to Juno’s facility, which is now Hercules’
instead.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">And as Dr. Juno lies on Alphabay, her
suit is badly damaged and she is badly hurt, with wounds all over his
body, beneath his suit. She knows that this is the very end of the
world. Dr. Hercules has won. Or has he?</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">When the ship returns to the Project
Hercules base, the 3 of them are separately put in confinement until
the research on them can commence. Doomsday is now nearing 75%
completion. Soon enough, it will happen. Everything will collapse and
be rebuilt in his image. </span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Hercules has effectively become the
Dark Lord, capable of mass destruction. He has even managed to beat Dr.
Juno, one of the most feared people to have ever existed. No one
individual has ever managed to defeat Dr. Juno. Especially not in a
single hit.</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once at the base, the Dark Diamond’s
every single detail is analyzed and despite its efforts, it cannot
escape or resist against anything they try to do. They measure its
energy levels and manage to create a new Bright Diamond with this same
energy level as well as modify the shards of the Dark Diamond to be at
the same energy level. In doing so, they have managed to harness
Corrupt Energy. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is no longer unstable. Dr. Hercules
also manages to synthesize replicas of these same shards using their
energy levels. They just need to be charged up by the Dark Diamond. As
Dr. Hercules meets the Dark Diamond again, he tells him about the real
reason Dr. Hades cared about the Dark Diamond: because the Dark Diamond
took the scientist's daughter. The Dark Diamond charged up in rage and
blasted him, which had no effect since it was in a confinement chamber.
But this was all to rile it up, so they can gather enough energy from
it to charge up the remaining synthesized shards.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">With everything in place, all they need
to do is get everything working. They can use the Dark Diamond's energy
to create a Dark Star. They never had sufficient amounts of the energy
needed, but they could now use the Dark Diamond’s energy to turn a Blue
Star into a Dark Star. Luckily they had many Blue Stars left over from
their failed experiments. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Bright Diamond would be
straightforward enough. TON would be used in the accelerator of the
device to increase power and be used in case of a power failure. KNB
would be forced to help manage it. But before things could be set in
motion, two anonymous people come in, wearing what seemed to be suits,
marked with the letter H on both shoulders. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Are they from Project Hades? They both
start to fight Dr. Hercules. Dr. Hercules calls them foolish if they
thought they stood a chance. Dr. Hercules orders his men to attack them
and grab them both by the arms as he unmasks them. The two people are
Dr. Juno and... Dr. Hades. Dr. Hercules is taken aback by their sudden
appearances, as he thought that Dr. Hades was taken away years ago, but
it turns out that he had somehow escaped a long time ago and had been
watching the battles unfold the entire time.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Overtaken by his own rage and disbelief,
Dr. Hercules grabs both of the scientists and slams them both into the
ground. As KNB, TON and the Dark Diamond try to escape, he forcibly
grabs the 3 of them and puts them back into place inside the Doomsday
device. The plan is finally ready for execution. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>As Dr. Hercules gives his speech to his army of
troops on what kind of an impact this may have on the world, they all

He has surpassed even the likes of Dr. Juno. He went from being Dr.
Juno's sidepiece to becoming the ruler of the Universe. He will have
surpassed even death itself. And as they all chant "HAIL HERCULES!" </span><span>one</span><span
 class="c0">&nbsp;last time, the Doomsday device is activated and
powers up with a high-pitched whirr.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the Doomsday device charges up to 1%,
KNB, TON and the Dark Diamond are determined to find a way out, but
they are unable to. They can't stop it. Dr. Hercules looks as dangerous
as ever. Ready to destroy anything that stands in his way. He truly has
become the Dark Lord. This Doomsday device he has built will bring
about Doomsday itself. The collapse of everything and what will be
rebuilt is a world in his own image. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">An hour has passed. Time is flying by
quicker every passing minute. The Doomsday device reaches 50%. This is
bad. They can't do anything, and before they know it, the Doomsday
device has charged up to 100%. At that very moment, the 3 of them
managed to escape from the device and try to stop it from continuing
its process while also fighting the Dark Lord at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the 3 of them begin taking him on,
TON is grabbed by the neck by the Dark Lord and with a blade of Corrupt
Energy, he is stabbed. As TON falls to the ground, he begins to
dematerialize. He is slowly turning into free-floating particles of
Corrupt Energy. The Dark Diamond and KNB try to fight him off, but the
same thing happens to KNB. He is brutally stabbed and disintegrates
within seconds. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Dark Diamond somehow does not die no
matter what, almost if it had somehow attained immortality. The Dark
Diamond is hit and stabbed by the blade and is sent flying, but it
doesn’t disintegrate like its fallen comrades. The Dark Lord is ready
for the Doomsday device to initiate. At last, he activates it. The Dark
Diamond sees the Universe collapse and tear apart before its eyes,
while Dr. Hercules laughs maniacally, conjuring a force field out of
thin air made of Corrupt Energy to protect himself and his men from the
violent reality-warping effects of his creation. All while everything
is slowly fading to black.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Dark Diamond then wakes up to find
that everything is gone. It's alone here, in a dark void. It wanders
around aimlessly for a few minutes, trying to regain its bearings. At
last, it sees a bright light a short distance away and follows it, not
knowing what lies ahead.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">A full ten minutes have passed. The Dark
Lord and his men get to their feet, having survived the powerful
effects of the Doomsday device. He is about to send his men and
machines out into his new world. Suddenly, he is grabbed from behind.
Then Dr. Hercules is hit with a powerful blast which sends him flying
away. He rapidly turns around to see the Dark Diamond in a super form.
It even has a mechanized human-like suit to go with it made of a form
of Adamantium. Dr. Hercules orders his troops to attack, but the Dark
Diamond instantly destroys them all with an energy blast. Seeing his
army crumble, Dr. Hercules tries to flee, but he is hit by the Dark
Diamond's blast once again. The knockback sends Dr. Hercules right into
the Blue Star and he is instantly vaporized by his own creation. The
Dark Diamond initiates a big blast which undoes the changes made to
reality by the Doomsday Device and brings back what was just destroyed.
But because of the massive amounts of energy needed to bring everything
back, it falls unconscious. The Dark Diamond wakes up a day later in a
small medical bay to find TON, KNB, Dr. Hades and Dr. Juno crowding
over it. They are all glad it woke up. &nbsp;From this day on, they all
ensure everything is used for good. They all agree to make the world
better and ensure that nothing of this destructive nature ever happens
again.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" class="c2"><span class="c0">This marks
the end of this story. Dr. Hercules, who was once a nobody, became the
Dark Lord. The one who wanted to rebuild the Universe itself. I also
thank my father for doing the right thing. I am not really human
though. I'm sentient but I'm also something else at the same time. If
you're wondering who I am, I will not tell you, as that's for you to
figure out yourself. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the story of the Dark
Diamond. The once cold void that became the hero of the Universe. </span></p>
